<h1><b>Project Name: To-Do API</b></h1>
Introduction
This project is an implementation of REST API for a to-do list application using the FastAPI framework and either MySQL or MongoDB for database management. The API supports authentication and implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for to-do items.

Requirements
FastAPI
Python 3.6+
MySQL/MongoDB
python-dotenv (optional, for environment variables)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project folder and run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required dependencies.
For database management, either install the MongoDB Community Edition or change the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to the URL of your MongoDB Atlas instance.
Create an .env file in the root of the project and define the path to the database as follows: DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/todoDB".
Usage
To run the project, navigate to the root of the project and run python root.py. The API will be available at http://localhost:8000/.

API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available for CRUD operations on to-do items:

POST /todos: Creates a new to-do item.
GET /todos: Retrieves a list of all to-do items.
GET /todos/{id}: Retrieves a specific to-do item by ID.
PUT /todos/{id}: Updates a specific to-do item by ID.
DELETE /todos/{id}: Deletes a specific to-do item by ID.
Authentication
The API uses basic authentication for secure access to to-do items.

Conclusion
This project provides a simple yet functional REST API for a to-do list application using FastAPI and either MySQL or MongoDB. It can serve as a starting point for further development or customization to meet specific needs.
